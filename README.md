Welcome to my digital laboratory for End-to-End (E2E) testing. This repository is a documented journey of mastering **Playwright**, progressing from foundational browser interactions to complex context management and precision locators.

## 🗺️ The Learning Roadmap

I've structured this project as a structured curriculum. Each module represents a specific skill set acquired during the learning process.

### 🟢 Stage 1: The Foundations (`01_Basics`)
*Focusing on the core mechanics of how Playwright interacts with the web.*
- **Key Labs**:
  - `Lab209.spec.ts`: Core interaction patterns.
  - `Lab210_Test_Annoations.spec.ts`: Mastering test annotations for better suite organization.
- **Tooling**: Includes `Util.ts` for shared helper logic.

### 🔵 Stage 2: Context & State (`02_First_Tests`)
*Moving beyond a single page to simulate multi-user scenarios and isolated environments.*
- **Core Concepts**: `BrowserContext`, multi-page handling, and manual context configuration.
- **Practical Application**:
  - `211` through `218`: Progressing from first runs to advanced context reuse.
  - **Tasks**: Deep dives into `OneBrowser_MultipleContext` and `OneContext_MultiplePages` scenarios.

### 🔴 Stage 3: Precision & Scale (`03_Locators_Commands`)
*The art of writing robust selectors and mastering navigation commands.*
- **Core Concepts**: Advanced Locators, `goto` commands, and real-world automation.
- **Applied Projects**:
  - `219` to `222`: Testing diverse sites including `automation.vwo.com` and `Command IQ`.
  - `223`: Mastering XPath for complex DOM traversal.
  - `224`: Using `getByRole` for accessible and robust element targeting.
  - `225`: CSS selectors for precision targeting.
  - `226`: Interaction patterns with `pressSequentially`.
  - `227`: Managing browser cookies and state.
  - **Capstone**: 
    - `Project2_Cura_Navigation.spec.ts` — a complete automation flow for Cura Healthcare.
    - `Project3_App.vwo.com.spec.ts` — comprehensive testing for app.vwo.com.
    - `Project3_vwo.com_FreeTrailInvalidEmail.spec.ts` — specialized edge-case testing for VWO.

### 🟠 Stage 4: Session & State Persistence (`04_Session_Storage`)
*Deep dive into maintaining user sessions and persisting state across test runs.*
- **Core Concepts**: Session storage, state saving/loading, and authenticated flows.
- **Practical Application**:
  - `228`: Session management fundamentals.
  - `229`: Applying session persistence to `app.vwo.com`.

## 🚀 CI/CD: The Quality Gate

Integrated GitHub Actions ensure that every new lab added maintains the stability of the existing suite.

**The Pipeline Logic:**
`Push` $\rightarrow$ `Install Deps` $\rightarrow$ `Browser Setup` $\rightarrow$ `Headless Execution` $\rightarrow$ `Artifact Upload`
